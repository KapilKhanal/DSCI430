					</span><span>MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset - (July 2018)</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span><b>For the most current quarterly update, please see the <i>new</i> Metro Regional Parcel Dataset</b> at <a target="_blank" href="https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metrogis-plan-regional-parcels">https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metrogis-plan-regional-parcels</a>.  The quarterly update of the Regional Parcel Dataset has transitioned to the new MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard schema.  
<br>
<br>This July 2018 version in the former schema will remain on the Commons for a period of time so users have time to transition to the new schema.
<br>
<br>This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees.  
<br>
<br>This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate systems from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  (See section 5 of the metadata).  The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.  Summary attribute  information is in the Attributes Overview.  Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the <a href="MetroGIS_Regional_Parcels_Attributes.pdf" target=_blank>MetroGIS Regional Parcels Attributes</a> document.
<br>
<br>The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset.  Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not.  (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.)  The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.  The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.  
<br>
<br>The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files.  The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.
<br>
<br>In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.  There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building.  Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.  Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.
<br>
<br>This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. 
<br>
<br>Additional information may be available from each county at the links listed below.  Also, any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person at each individual county.

						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  However, not all attributes are available for all counties.  No attempt has been made by MetroGIS to assess the accuracy of the attribute data.
<br>
<br>Additional or missing attributes may be available from local assessors.
<br>
<br>Any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person listed in the individual county metadata.   Links to that metadata can be found in the Horizontal Positional Accuracy element below.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>No attempt was made to edgematch or rubbersheet the seven counties, thus overlaps and gaps will exist between counties.  Not all tax parcels are represented by a unique polygon.   For example, a county might have one polygon representing a condominium complex.  Some counties have provided an additional parcel points shape file that will include points to represent such tax parcels (e.g. a point for each individual condominium).</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>For parcel attributes, see Section 5 of this metadata.
<br>
<br>Any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person listed in the individual county metadata.   
<br>
<br>Inclusion of Condominiums in Polygon Dataset:
<br>Some counties include condominium information within their polygon dataset and others do not.  Some information on this topic is shown below.  Contact each county for further information.
<br>
<br>Dakota
<br>One polygon is included in the polygon dataset for the geography of the larger common area of a condominium building or complex.  Individual condominium units are only represented in the points dataset. 
<br>
<br>Ramsey (July 2018)
<br>Polygons are included for all condominiums.  The only 1 to many polygon/points are for manufactured homes
